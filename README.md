## 🔄 Project Working Procedure

1. **Sensor Data Collection**

   * Soil Moisture sensor checks the dryness level of the soil.
   * Rain Sensor detects whether it is raining.
   * (Optional) DHT22 monitors temperature & humidity.

2. **Data Processing with ESP32**

   * ESP32 reads sensor values.
   * Sends real-time data to the **Blynk Dashboard**.

3. **Decision Making**

   * If soil is dry **AND** no rain → Relay turns **ON** → Pump starts watering.
   * If soil is wet **OR** rain is detected → Pump remains **OFF**.

4. **Remote Monitoring (Blynk App)**

   * Soil & Rain status shown on dashboard.
   * Manual ON/OFF control of water pump possible.
   * Notification alert for rainfall event.

5. **Final Testing**

   * Connected all components on breadboard.
   * Tested in small plant pot.
   * Verified real-time soil condition & pump operation from Blynk app.
